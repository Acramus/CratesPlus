If you're having config issues (such as it resetting) first make sure it's a valid YAML file using a [parser](http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com).

From version 4.3 there is a new '/crates debug' command. Running this will give you a single link with all the data I need to help you. Please run this and submit the share link with your issue.

### Debug Link
___Enter your debug link from `/crates debug`. Not providing this may result in the issue being closed without warning. If you are unable to use this command please provide your Bukkit version, a list of plugins and your config.yml for CratesPlus.___

### Link/paste of stack trace/error (if any)

    You can also simply just use code formatting in markdown!
___We need all of the stack trace! Do not cut off parts of it.___

### Actions to reproduce (if known):
